## Hi!

Hi, I'm Daniel. A passionate full stack developer with great experience, mainly on Angular, Django and Flutter.

### Education

I'm currently a college student at the Federal University of Alagoas.

In the first half of elementary school I studied at Colégio Batista. After that, I went to Colégio Santa Úrsula, where I spent the rest of elementary school and all of middle school.

### About me

While in middle school, I became a self-taught programmer and I used this knowledge to make scripts for servers of a game called Tibia.
Then I started visiting some Tibia forums and sharing my knowledge. Thanks to that, one day an admin from a big forum reached out to me and invited me to be part of the forum's staff. I then happily accepted and eventually became one of the top staff members.

### Experience & Projects

As I said, I started programming in middle school, where I made scripts for Tibia servers. After that I wanted to make my own game, so I began to develop a game on Unity 3D, but I never finished it.

But anyway, here are some of my work:
- A copy of Super Mario Bros, using C programming language;
- A library management system, using C programming language;
- A blog to talk about pop culture, using AngularJs and C#;
- An online shop store, using Angular 2 and Django;
- A terminal aplication to encrypt and store sensitive text, using C++;
- A huffman compression and decompression application, using C.
- A library management web application, using Angular 4 and Django;
- A payroll system, using Java.

Currently I'm working in partnership with Petrobras, developing some web systems to plan and to monitor oilfields. I've been working on this project for almost 3 years now, using Angular and Django.
